# Custom Reforged Eden 2 Scenerio

## Goals
1. Reduce Star Size for a smaller multiplayer server
- Increase Star Ship Range to match
-  Increase Teleport Range
-  IF we can increase viability of early game spapce that would be ideal. Might have issues with set faction space placement
2. Increase Resources espically late game
3. Reduce skill points for select items (mostly hydroponic bays)
4. Rename so we don't get autoupdated over

## Notes from last playthrough
- No one used drones
- Stalled mid-game for most
- Players would get seperated and mildly ruin the coop
