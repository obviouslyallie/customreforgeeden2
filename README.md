# Custom Reforged Eden 2 Scenerio

## Goals
For a smaller server we want to promote unity and coop experience slightly more than the current settings. Typically play less than 8 people so a huge galaxy isn't ideal. Current idea is to drop galaxty of roughly 30,000 stars to sub 4,000 stars.

## Actions 
1. Reduce Stars
   -Increase LY/AU range
   -Increaes Teleporter Range
2. Increase Resources espically for late game
3. Reduce skill points for select items (mostly hydroponic bays)
4. Rename in order to avoid autoupdate

## Possible Issues
- Sector size will need testing
- Faction space placements are hard defined and not based on galaxy size
- With such a reduction those stars might need to be more valuble
- Overdoing changes might result in a mining grind or no reason to move at all.
  
## Notes from last playthrough
- No one used drones
- Stalled mid-game for most
- Players would get seperated and mildly ruin the coop experience
